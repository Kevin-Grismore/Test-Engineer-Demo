# Test Engineer Demo

This is a sample project intended to demonstrate the use of NUnit and Selenium in C#. 

The Razor Pages project is based on this tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-5.0, rethemed around games with the addition of an age checker on the Details page of each game to demonstrate ESRB rating enforcement.
