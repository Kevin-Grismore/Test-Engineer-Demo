# Test Engineer Demo

This is a sample project intended to demonstrate the use of NUnit and Selenium in C#. 

The Razor Pages project is based on this tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-5.0, rethemed around games.
An age checker on the Details page of each game to demonstrate ESRB rating enforcement has also been added.

### Build Requirements
.NET Core 5.0 SDK https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0

### Framework
The backing for Selenium, as well as the definitions for the base Game and specific game classes are contained in this project.
#### Models
Game definitions are stored in a local SQLite database. The Game model describes a basic Game object and its properties as it exists in the database. The virtual properties are overridden in specific Game definitions that inherit the base class to verify them against the pre-seeded database entries.

#### Selenium
The Selenium driver is wrapped for customizable functionality, including the ThreadStatic attribute for simple, parallelized use of the driver and its associated methods.

#### Services
The IGameService interface requires any implementing service to offer the ability to retrieve a game's definition by name only. This is demonstrated in InMemoryGameService, which serves instances of games by name.


### Games
This project contains page map models for each of the web pages that is tested in Games.UITests. The PageBase includes the header navigation bar abstract class, which is inherited by all other page classes as it is present on every page of the site.

The rest of the pages inclue a page map class, which defines what elements are present on each page, and a page class, which defines what the user can do with those elements.

AllPages encapsulates a ThreadStatic instance of each page so they may be tested in parallel alongside the ThreadStatic Selenium driver.
